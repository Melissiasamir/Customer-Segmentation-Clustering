## 🚀 Features  
✔️ **Data Preprocessing** – handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.  
✔️ **Clustering Algorithms** – implemented **K-Means** and **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** for segmentation.  
✔️ **Model Evaluation** – using **Silhouette Score** and **visualizations** to assess clustering quality.  
✔️ **Interactive Streamlit App** – intuitive UI to:  
   - Select **country** and other features.  
   - Visualize customer clusters.  
   - Display model insights in real-time.

## 🧩 Implemented Models  
- **K-Means Clustering** – partitions customers into k clusters based on similarity.  
- **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** – probabilistic clustering that allows soft assignments.

## 📈 Visualizations  
- **Cluster Scatter Plots** – income vs spending score, colored by cluster.  
- **Distribution Graphs** – show data distribution for better understanding.  
- **Model Comparisons** – visualize differences between K-Means and GMM results.
